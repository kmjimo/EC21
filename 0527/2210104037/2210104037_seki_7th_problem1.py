This problen is symmetrical for S_A and S_B, that is, 
summation of S_A exceeds an half of total sum of S (= W) by delta,
summation of S_B falls W by delta simultaneously.
Therfore, we can solve it applying Dynamic Programming (DP), 
which works out Knapsack problem, well-known NP-complete problem.
Note that desired difference is given from double of delta.
